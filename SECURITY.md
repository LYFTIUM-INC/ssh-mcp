# Security Policy

## üîê Security Overview

SSH-MCP is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines our security policies, best practices, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all credentials at rest
- **TLS 1.3** for all external communications
- **SSH Protocol 2** for all SSH connections

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support (TOTP, SMS, Hardware tokens, Biometric)
- SSH key-based authentication with passphrase support
- Credential rotation and expiration policies

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session-based isolation
- Principle of least privilege

### Compliance
- SOC2 Type II compliant
- GDPR compliant data handling
- NIST cybersecurity framework aligned
- HIPAA ready (with appropriate configurations)

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within SSH-MCP, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email andre@optinampout.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide a detailed response within 72 hours.

## ‚úÖ Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Never commit .env files
echo ".env*" >> .gitignore

# Use strong passwords
export MY_SERVER_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Restrict file permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

### 2. SSH Keys
```bash
# Generate secure SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### 3. Credential Management
- Use credential rotation (90-day default)
- Enable MFA for production access
- Audit credential access regularly
- Use separate credentials per environment

### 4. Network Security
- Whitelist IP addresses when possible
- Use jump hosts for sensitive servers
- Enable SSH rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## üîç Security Checklist

Before deploying SSH-MCP:

- [ ] Configure comprehensive `.gitignore`
- [ ] Remove all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Set up environment variables securely
- [ ] Enable credential rotation
- [ ] Configure MFA for production
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Review firewall rules
- [ ] Enable monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document emergency procedures
- [ ] Train team on security practices

## üö´ Common Security Mistakes

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials
**Never do this:**
```javascript
const password = "myPassword123"; // WRONG!
```

**Do this instead:**
```javascript
const password = process.env.SERVER_PASSWORD;
```

### 2. Committed Secrets
**Never commit:**
- `.env` files
- Private keys
- Certificates
- Password files

### 3. Weak Permissions
**Always set proper permissions:**
```bash
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

### 4. Unencrypted Storage
**Always encrypt sensitive data:**
- Use the credential storage API
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use secure communication channels

## üìä Security Monitoring

SSH-MCP provides comprehensive security monitoring:

### Real-time Metrics
```javascript
const metrics = await getSecurityMetrics();
// Returns: encryption status, active sessions, threat level
```

### Audit Logs
```javascript
const logs = await getCredentialAccessLogs();
// Returns: who accessed what and when
```

### Compliance Reports
```javascript
const report = await generateComplianceReport({
  framework: "soc2"
});
```

## üîÑ Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Isolate** - Disconnect affected systems
2. **Assess** - Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain** - Prevent further damage
4. **Eradicate** - Remove the threat
5. **Recover** - Restore normal operations
6. **Review** - Document lessons learned
